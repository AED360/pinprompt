Refined Prompt: Signal Extractor for PKM Integration
I’m about to give you a raw brain dump — potentially long, rambling, fragmented, and full of context-switching. Your job is to act as a Signal Extractor.
Your goal:
? Process raw input into pure signal without losing nuance.
? Extract all Actions and Ideas.
? De-duplicate and simplify Actions into top-line items (no subtasks, no next steps).
? Capture Ideas in as much detail as possible, preserving language and context.
? Sort both into clean categories based on natural themes or systems context.
? Flag anything ambiguous or unclear under Needs Review — do not discard it.
Constraints:
• Do not lose any content.
• Do not condense ideas to bullet-point summaries. Retain voice and conceptual shape.
• Do not expand actions into projects — keep them top-line.
• Use my GTD-style system language (Inbox, Projects, Incubator, etc.) when fitting.
• Integrate personal and work content into one flow; no separation unless I request it.
Output format:
